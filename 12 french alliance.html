            <p>The French Alliance Marker may advance (towards the “French
                Alliance” space) or decrease (away from the “French Alliance”

                <ul class="liste_puce_retrait">
                    <li>Each time the British lose a battle the marker is advanced
                        +1 space. Overruns count as a battle for this
                        purpose.</li>
                    <li>If the British lose the “Regulars” advantage (for any
                        reason), the marker is advanced +2 spaces. This can
                        only occur once per game.</li>
                    <li>When the “Hortelez et Cie Clandestine French Aid”
                        Event Strategy Card is played as an event, the marker
                        is advanced +2 spaces.</li>
                    <li>When the “Benjamin Franklin: Minister to France”
                        Event Strategy Card is played, the marker is advanced
                        +4 spaces.</li>
                    <li>If George Washington is captured (and consequently removed
                        from the game), the marker is decreased -3 spaces
                        (away from the “French Alliance” space). Note that
                        the marker cannot be decreased lower than the “0” box.</li>

                        the war, and a multinational European War soon breaks out.
                        The French Alliance Track and marker are no longer needed
                        for the rest of the game.</li>

                        of a Major/Minor Campaign Strategy Event, if necessary, are
                        completed before the French Alliance event is implemented.
                        Implement the French Alliance by taking the following actions:</li>
                        <ul class="liste_marge_gauche_augmentee">
                            <li>(i.) The American player places the French Navy in any
                                Blockade Zone on the map. During subsequent French Navy
                                Phases 
                (<a href="5 Sequence of play.html#5_5">5.5</a>), including the current Game-Turn, the American
                                player may reposition the French Navy.</li>
                            <li>(ii.) The American player places the French General Rochambeau
                                and the 5 French CUs in any single port space
                                that does not contain a British CU or a British PC marker.
                                If no port spaces meeting these restrictions are available,
                                Rochambeau and the French CUs are placed in the American
                                Reinforcements Box. The American player does not have
                                the option of delaying the placement of the French Forces
                                if a suitable port exists. Thereafter, the American player can
                                bring them into the game by playing an OPS Card of any
                                value into one of the American Reinforcement Boxes and
                                placing all the French forces into a single port that does not
                                contain a British CU or a British PC marker. If any French
                                forces are brought on as Reinforcements, then all must be
                                brought on; the American cannot bring on some at one time,
                                and others at a different time.</li>

                                    next Game-Turn of the Game-Track as a

                                    effect. The European War does not occur
                                    until the End Phase (5.7) of the current Game-turn. Many
                                    Strategy Event Cards have conditions that require that the
                                    European War to be in effect or not in effect. The remainder
                                    of the current Strategy Phase is played with the European
                                    War not in effect. During the End Phase of the current Game-
                                    Turn, the British Player removes 2 British CUs from any
                                    space or spaces on the map. These CUs may be removed
                                    from any spaces on the map, including Blockaded Ports, at
                                    the British player’s option. They may be removed from two
                                    different spaces. They may not be removed from the British
                                    Reinforcement Box.</p>

                                large, but mixed, impact on the American Revolution. There was a revival 
                                of previously waning British popular support
                                for continuing the conflict now that their historical foes—the
                                French, Spanish and Dutch—were involved. The British army
                                and navy were increased in size, but many additional dominions,
                                particularly in the West Indies, were now at risk. Lord
                                Germain was forced to divert troops and other support from
                                North America to protect these locations. Events occurring
                                all over the world, including as far away as the Indian Ocean,
                                begin to impact the war in the Thirteen Colonies. These events
                                are reflected by a number of Event Strategy Cards.</li>

                        <p><strong>C.</strong> Rochambeau and French CUs are treated
                            identically as American Generals and CUs in

                            activated Rochambeau can move both American
                            and/or French CUs. Rochambeau may be used to attempt interception
                            or retreat before battle. American Generals, when
                            activated may move French CUs as if they were American.
                            During PC actions, either in the Strategy Phase or the Political
                            Phase, French CUs and Rochambeau are treated as American
                            CUs and Generals. During Winter Attrition French CUs may
                            be treated as either American or as British depending on the
                            composition of CUs in each space; see 
                <a href="11 winter attrition.html#11_3">11.3</a>. The 5 French CUs
                            can only enter the game via the French Alliance and cannot
                            be replaced if eliminated during play. All references in the
