            <h1 class="titre_chapitre">5.0 SEQUENCE OF PLAY</h1>
            <p>Washington’s War follows a specific sequence of play. All activities
                of one phase must be completed before the subsequent phase
                is started. Within a phase, all activities of one segment must be
                completed before the next segment is started. Within a segment,
                players may perform their activities simultaneously or in any
                order agreeable to both players. Should an issue arise where
                both players do not agree, the American player determines the
                order, but from that point forward the order of activities for that
                segment cannot be changed.</p>
            <p class="titres_sequence_of_play">5.1 Reinforcements Phase</p>
            <p>If either player’s Generals are in Captured Generals box, they
                are moved to their respective Reinforcements boxes. The British
                player then gets Combat Units equal to the number listed for the
                current turn on the turn track and places them in his Reinforcements
                box; see 
        <a href="8 reinforcement.html#8_1_A">8.1.A</a>.
                </p>
            <p class="titres_sequence_of_play">5.2 Strategy Cards Phase</p>
            <p>Deal seven Strategy Cards to each player. The American player
                is always dealt the first card. When the Strategy Deck is fully
                depleted, or at the beginning of a turn after an event occurs requiring
                a reshuffle of the Strategy Deck, the Strategy Card Deck
                is reconstituted; see . 
        <a href="6 strategy cards.html#6_1">6.1</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="titres_sequence_of_play" id="5_3">5.3 Strategy Phase</p>
            <p>A determination is made as to which player chooses who goes
                first in the following priority order:
            </p>
            <ol class="liste_sequence_of_play">
                <li>The British player may declare himself the first player
                    by playing a Campaign card (Major or Minor) as the first
                    card.</li>
                <li>If on the previous turn the Congress was dispersed (
            <a href="7 movement.html#7_7">7.7</a>)
                    the British player chooses who will play the first Strategy
                    card.</li>
                <li>In all other circumstances the American player chooses
                    who will play the first Strategy card.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The players then take alternate impulses, each playing one Strategy
                card, until both players’ hands are empty, at which point the
                Strategy Phase ends. In some turns, one player might run out of 
                cards well before the other, in which case the player with cards
                remaining continues to play until his cards run out. Cards may
                not be “saved” until the next turn, nor may a player “pass” his
                impulse so long as he has cards in his hand.
            </p>
            <p>The play of each Strategy card allows that player to do one of
                the following:</p>
            <ol class="liste_sequence_of_play">
                <li>move a General;</li>
                <li>take control of spaces, putting PC Markers in those
                    spaces;</li>
                <li>cause the card’s Event to happen;</li>
                <li>acquire Reinforcements.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Except for Special Event Strategy Cards, a player may satisfy
                a card play by discarding a card (all information on the card is
                ignored); see 
        <a href="6 strategy cards.html#6_32">6.32</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="titres_sequence_of_play" id="5_4">5.4 Winter Attrition Phase</p>
            <p>All CUs are checked for possible Winter Attrition Losses. The
                nationality of the CUs, the location of the CUs with respect to
                the Winter Attrition Line and Winter Quarters spaces and whether
                they are stacked with a General influence their possible losses;
                see 
        <a href="11 winter attrition.html">11.0</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="titres_sequence_of_play" id="5_5">5.5 French Naval Phase</p>
            <p>During this phase, and only during this phase, the French Navy
                may be relocated. The American player picks up the French Navy
                counter and relocates it to any Blockade Zone he wishes; see 
        <a href="12 french alliance.html#12_3">12.3</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="titres_sequence_of_play" id="5_6">5.6 Political Control Phase</p>
            <p>If the Continental Congress has been dispersed, the American
                player returns it to play. Each player places PC markers in spaces
                containing his Armies. Lastly isolated PC markers are removed;
                see
        <a href="10 political control.html#10_2">10.2</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="titres_sequence_of_play">5.7 End Phase</p>
            <p>If the French Alliance was triggered during the current Game-
                Turn, European War breaks out and the British player removes
                2 CUs from the map; see. 
        <a href="12 french alliance.html#12_2_B_iii">12.2.B.iii</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="end_phase"> If an Automatic Victory has not occurred (13.1), the game ends if
                the “Lord North’s Government Falls—War Ends” Event Strategy
                Card in the War Ends box states that the game ends on this turn or
                a previous turn. If the game ends, determine the winner per. 
        <a href="13 victory.html#13_2">13.2</a>.</p>
            <p class="end_phase"> If the game has not ended, move all OPS Cards from the Reinforcements
            Cards boxes to the Discard pile and begin a new
            Game Turn by advancing the Game Turn Marker to the next
            space on the Game Turn Track.</p>
            <div class="precision">
                <p class="titres_sequence_of_play">End Phase Clarification</p>
                <p>During an End Phase all OPS queues and any other game
                    process that the players can conceive of or imagine; stops,
                    and cannot carry over into the next game turn.
                    In the unlikely event that a “Lord North’s Government Falls—
                    War Ends” Event Strategy card is not drawn during the course
                    of a game, the game ends at the end of 1783.
