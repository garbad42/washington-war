            <p>Movement only occurs during the Strategy Phase and only when
                Generals have been activated by an OPS Card, “John Glover
                Marblehead Regiment” Event Strategy Card or by a “Major/
                Minor Campaign” Event Strategy Card. A Combat Unit (CU)
                may only move when accompanied by an activated General.
            </p>
            <p>American Armies may conduct interceptions and retreats before
                battle, and thus make minor changes to their locations during the
                Strategy Phase, but these mechanics do not require activation of
                a General and are covered separately.

                <li><strong>A.</strong> To activate a General with a Strategy Rating of 3 (e.g., Carleton),
                    play an OPS Card with the number 3 on it. To activate
                    a General with a Strategy Rating of 2 (e.g., Gates), play an
                    OPS Card with either the number 3 or 2 on it. A General with
                    a strategy rating of 1 (e.g., Greene) may be activated by the
                    play of any OPS Card.

                <p id="7_1_B"><strong>B.</strong> Instead of activating a General with the play
                    of a single OPS Card, a player may choose to
                    create an Operations Queue.

                    <strong>(i.)</strong> A player establishes the start of an Operations
                    Queue by playing an OPS Card with the
                    number 1 or 2 face up in front of the player and stating that it
                    is an Operations Queue. Place an Operations Queue marker
                    on top of the card or cards played into the Queue.</p></div></div>
                <li class="liste_i"><strong>(ii.)</strong> On the player’s next Strategy Card play, he plays an
                    additional OPS Card into the Queue. He may then activate
                    a General with a Strategy Rating less than or equal to the
                    total value of the OPS Cards. Alternatively he may choose
                    to continue the Operations Queue.</li>
                <li class="liste_i"><strong>(iii.)</strong> When creating an Operations Queue, the player must
                    play each subsequent Strategy Card into the Queue until
                    he uses the Queue or abandons it. The Operations Queue
                    is abandoned if the player discards or plays any Strategy
                    Card to perform a different activity. (Note: This applies to
                    the sequential plays of Strategy Cards during the Strategy
                    Phase. Battle Cards played and other Event Strategy Cards
                    discarded during resolution of a battle do not cause abandonment
                    of the Operations Queue.) When an Operations
                    Queue has been completed (used to activate a General) or
                    abandoned, place all the OPS Cards face up on the discard
                    pile. <em> Discard of an OPS card to pick up a discarded Event
                    does not cancel the OPS Queue.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="exemple"><strong>Example:</strong> The British player holds a hand of three 1 OPS Cards,
                one 3 OPS Card and three event cards. During the course of the
                game turn he foresees the possible need to move Howe, Cornwallis
                and/or Burgoyne. As his first play, he places one of the 1 OPS
                Cards in front of him and starts an Operations Queue, placing an
                “Operations Queue” marker on top of it. The American player
                makes a routine play that does not change the British player’s
                plan. The British player then plays the second 1 OPS Card into
                the Operations Queue. The queue now totals two, so he activates
                Burgoyne for movement. After the move is completed, both 1 OPS
                Cards are placed in the Discard Pile.
            </p>
            <p class="exemple"><strong>Example:</strong>With the same starting situation as above, the American
                player takes an action that the British player believes must
                be responded to by playing one of his Event Strategy Cards as
                the event. He does so, but has interrupted his continual play of
                cards into the Operations Queue and thus abandoned it. The event
                is implemented but the 1 OPS Card in the Operations Queue is placed 
                in the discard pile. The British player may start a new
                Operations Queue with his next play.
            </p>
            <p class="exemple"><strong>Example:</strong>With the same starting situation as above, the Operations
                Queue has grown to hold two 1 OPS Cards. After the
                American’s second play, the British player decides he wishes to
                activate Cornwallis. Even though there are already two 1 OPS
                Cards in the queue, he must still play another card into the queue
                in order to activate a General. He cannot play an event and
                also activate Cornwallis, nor may he pass on playing a card to
                activate Cornwallis. He plays the remaining 1 OPS Card into the
                queue and now has three operations points, so he may activate
                any British General that he chooses.

            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>A.</strong> By playing a “Major Campaign” Event Strategy Card, a
                    player may activate up to three of his Generals, regardless of
                    their Strategy Ratings. By playing a “Minor Campaign” Event
                    Strategy Card, he may activate up to two Generals (regardless
                    of their Strategy Ratings). The first General must finish
                    his entire activation (including any Battles he wishes to fight)
                    before the next General begins. A General cannot be activated
                    more than once in a Campaign, nor may a given CU be moved
                    by more than one General during a campaign. The player need
                    not announce which Generals will be activated when the card
                    is played; the player may move one General, and then select
                    which General he will activate next and so on until all Generals
                    have completed their activations.

            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>A.</strong> When activated, a General may move a maximum of four
                    spaces from the space in which he begins the activation (<strong>Exception:</strong>
                    American Mobility Advantage; see 
            <a href="#7_3_C">7.3.C</a>). During
                    his move, a General may take up to five CUs with him. The
                    General may change the constitution of his Army while moving
                    by picking up and dropping off CUs along the way, but at no
                    time may that Army move with more than five CUs.</li>
                <li><strong>B.</strong> Movement is traced along the solid and dashed lines connecting
                    adjacent spaces. The movement of an Army ends when
                    it enters a space containing an enemy CU. (<strong>Exception:</strong> Overruns
            <a href="9 battles.html#9_7">9.7</a>) Movement is complete even if the enemy Army occupying
                    the space successfully executes a retreat before battle.</li>
                <li id="7_3_C"><strong>C. Special American Mobility Advantage:</strong> American Generals
                    and any CUs with them may move up to five spaces
                    provided that they do not execute an Overrun nor end the
                    move in a space occupied by any enemy CUs (i.e., the Army
                    may not move 5 spaces and enter into a Battle). American
                    Generals moving alone may also move five spaces subject to
                    normal movement restrictions; see 
            <a href="#7_4">7.4</a>. An American Army
                    may capture British Generals unaccompanied by CUs while

                    Overruns, for that activation only. Remember that the card
                    text in an Event supersedes the rules.</em></li>

                <li><em><strong>Example:</strong> General Gates and four CUs begin in Ninety-Six.
                    The American player plays a 2 OPS Card to activate General
                    Gates, who moves, via Camden, two spaces to Eutaw Springs,
                    where he drops off two CUs. One space further along in
                    Charleston, three CUs await, and General Gates moves there
                    to pick them up (he now has his maximum of 5). He ends his
                    activation by moving one more space (total of 4) and ends his
                    movement in Savannah. Because Gates is an American General
                    and is participating neither in an overrun nor in a battle, he
                    could optionally continue his move to Augusta or St. Mary’s

                    for restrictions on the Falmouth-Quebec connection.</li>
                <li><em><strong>Example:</strong> moving from Fort Detroit to Basset Town, PA counts

            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>A.</strong> In order to enter a space containing an enemy CU, a General
                    must be moving with at least one friendly CU. A General
                    moving without a CU may move through a space containing
                    an enemy General without accompanying CUs, but may not

                <li><strong>B.</strong> No General moving alone can enter a space with an enemy
                    PC marker.</li>
                <li><strong>C.</strong> A General may end his move, his retreat, or his interception
                    in the same space as another friendly General, whether
                    or not either General has CUs with him. If a General does end
                    a move in the same space as a friendly General, one of the
                    Generals—owner’s choice—must be placed in the Reinforcements
                    Box. General Washington may never be removed to the
                    Reinforcement Box.</li>

                    or with CUs. Note that this is also a Wilderness Connection

                    Interception, or Retreat), that General is captured. The Army
                    may continue moving. The Captured General is placed in the
                    Captured Generals Box, and during the Reinforcements Phase
                    of the following game-turn, he (like every other captured General)
                    is placed in his side’s Reinforcements Box.</li>
                <li class="design_note"><em><strong>Design Note:</strong> Both sides in the Revolutionary War regularly
                    exchanged high ranking prisoners of war; this rule covers
                    that practice. By contrast, lower-ranking prisoners stayed in
                    squalid prison camps for long periods of time.</em></li>
                <li><strong>B. SPECIAL RULE: George Washington Capture:</strong> If
                    George Washington is captured, he is removed from the
                    game. The British player immediately removes 5 American
                    PC markers, no more than one per colony (including Canada)
                    in any space that does not contain an American CU, General,
                    or the Continental Congress. In addition, if France has not
                    yet entered the war move the French Alliance marker three
                    spaces to the negative.</li>

                <img src="images/illustration 7.7 continental congress.gif"alt="continental congress">
                <p>If the British Army enters the space containing
                    the Continental Congress and it is unaccompanied
                    by American CUs, the Congress is dispersed. The
                    British Army may continue moving. If a battle (or
                    overrun) takes place in the space occupied by the
                    Continental Congress and the American forces are eliminated or
                    forced to retreat, then the Continental Congress is dispersed.
                    When dispersed, place the Continental Congress marker into the
                    Continental Congress Dispersed Box on the map. The counter
                    comes back into play in the Political Control Phase. Note that
                    there are substantial restrictions to the American player while
                    the Congress is dispersed.

            <h3 id="7_8">7.8 Interception (Americans only)</h3>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>A.</strong> American Armies may intercept moving British Armies
                    under certain circumstances. The American player may attempt
                    to make an interception, subject to some restrictions, when
                    the British Army moves into an adjacent space that contains
                    an American PC marker. To resolve the interception attempt,
                    the American player rolls a die and compares the result to the
                    Agility Rating of the intercepting General. The interception
                    is successful if the result is less than or equal to the Agility
                    Rating; otherwise it fails.</li>
                <li><strong>B.</strong> Interception may not be attempted into spaces which already
                    contain British CUs prior to the entry of the moving
                    Army. British Armies using Naval Movement (
        <a href="#7_5">7.5</a>) may not
                    be intercepted. British Generals moving without CUs may not
                    be intercepted.</li>
                <li><strong>C.</strong> Successful interception results in the placement of the intercepting
                    General and all CUs stacked with him into the space
                    just entered by the British Army. (<em><strong>Exception:</strong> If the intercepting
                    General is stacked with more than 5 CUs, all CUs in excess
                    of 5 remain in their original space.</em>) Interception immediately
                    ends the British movement and initiates the Combat Resolution
                    Procedure (
        <a href="9 battles.html#9_2">9.2</a>).</li>
                <li><strong>D.</strong> American Armies may intercept into spaces which already
                    contain American CUs. In this case the American player may
                    be required to remove an excess General of his choice to the
                    Reinforcement Box prior to the resolution of the battle. Once an interception takes place, the Americans may not attempt a
                    retreat before battle.</li>
                <li><strong>E.</strong> Multiple Armies may attempt to intercept into the same space,
                    but the first successful interception immediately ends British
                    movement, causes a battle and prevents any further interceptions
                    by other Armies from occurring during that activation. No Army
                    may attempt interception more than <em>once per Strategy Card</em>
                    played by the British player; i.e., during a British Campaign
                    event each American Army is allowed a total of <em>one</em> interception
                    attempt. Whether an interception attempt is successful or not,
                    any Army attempting interception may not subsequently attempt
                    a Retreat Before Battle until the next Strategy Card is played.</li>
                <li><strong>F.</strong> When an interception is successful, the intercepting force is
                    considered to be in the space before the arrival of the moving
                    British Army. If the American Army is subsequently forced
                    to retreat, it may use any legal retreat route from that space, it
                    need not retreat back to the space from which it intercepted.
                    Conversely if the British Army is required to retreat, it must
                    retreat back into the space it left upon entering the intercept
                    space, even if this forces it to retreat back onto an American
                    PC (and thus is forced to Surrender, see 
        <a href="9 battles.html#9_63">9.63</a>).</li>
                <img class="image_verticale_centree" src="images/illustration 7.8 interception.gif" alt="7.8 interception">
                <li><em><strong>Example:</strong> A British Army enters a space containing an American
                    PC Marker, which is adjacent to an American Army led
                    by General Arnold. The American player chooses to attempt
                    interception by rolling the die. Since Arnold’s Agility Rating
                    is a 2, the attempt succeeds on a die roll of 1 or 2. If successful,
                    Arnold and his Army (up to 5 CUs) are placed into the
                    Interception space and a Battle is fought. If the die roll is 3
                    through 6, the interception attempt fails and the British Army
                    may continue moving. If any British Army, during the play of
                    this Strategy Card, attacks Arnold’s Army by entering its space,
                    they may not attempt to Retreat Before Battle.</em></li>

            <h3 id="7_9">7.9 Retreat Before Battle (Americans Only)</h3>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>A.</strong> When a British Army enters a space containing an American
                    Army, the American player may attempt to retreat before battle.
                    To resolve the retreat before battle attempt, the American player rolls a die and compares the result to the Agility Rating. If the
                    die roll result is less than or equal to the Agility Rating, the
                    retreat before battle attempt is successful.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Rule:</strong> Washington and Greene enjoy a special +2
                    modification to their Agility Rating when attempting retreat
                    before battle.</li>
                <li><em><strong>Reminder:</strong> An American Army that has attempted interception
                    (successfully or unsuccessfully) may not attempt retreat before
                    battle if subsequently attacked by a British Army at any point
                    during play of the same Strategy Card.</em></li>
                 <li><strong>B.</strong> If the retreat before battle attempt is successful, the American
                    Army conducts a retreat using the battle retreat mechanics
                    and restrictions in 
        <a href="9 battles.html#9_61">9.61</a>. If the American Army has more than
                    5 CUs, only the General and 5 CUs may be retreated. All
                    remaining CUs conduct battle or are overrun as appropriate.
                    If the retreat before battle attempt is unsuccessful, proceed
                    immediately to the Combat Resolution Procedure (
        <a href="9 battles.html#9_2">9.2</a>). The
                    British Army must stop moving in the space vacated in any
                    case, even if they overrun an American CU left behind. All
                    desired interception attempts resulting from the movement of
                    the British Army into the space need to be resolved before the
                    retreat from battle attempt is made.</li>
                <li><strong>C.</strong> There is no limit on the number of times that a particular
                    American Army may attempt to retreat before battle during a
                    single Strategy Phase; i.e., an American Army attacked during
                    each activation of a British Campaign Event may attempt to
                    retreat before battle in each case.</li>
