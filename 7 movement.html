            <h1 class="titre_chapitre">7.0 MOVEMENT</h1>
            <p>Movement only occurs during the Strategy Phase and only when
                Generals have been activated by an OPS Card, “John Glover
                Marblehead Regiment” Event Strategy Card or by a “Major/
                Minor Campaign” Event Strategy Card. A Combat Unit (CU)
                may only move when accompanied by an activated General.
            </p>
            <p>American Armies may conduct interceptions and retreats before
                battle, and thus make minor changes to their locations during the
                Strategy Phase, but these mechanics do not require activation of
                a General and are covered separately.

            <h3 id="7_1">7.1 Activating Generals with OPS Cards</h3>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>A.</strong> To activate a General with a Strategy Rating of 3 (e.g., Carleton),
                    play an OPS Card with the number 3 on it. To activate
                    a General with a Strategy Rating of 2 (e.g., Gates), play an
                    OPS Card with either the number 3 or 2 on it. A General with
                    a strategy rating of 1 (e.g., Greene) may be activated by the
                    play of any OPS Card.
                </li>
                <div class="image_imbriquee">
                <img class="operation_queue" src="images/illustration 7.1 operation queue.gif" alt="operation queue">
                <div>
                <p>
                    <strong>B.</strong> Instead of activating a General with the play
                    of a single OPS Card, a player may choose to
                    create an Operations Queue.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="liste_i">
                    <strong>(i.)</strong> A player establishes the start of an Operations
                    Queue by playing an OPS Card with the
                    number 1 or 2 face up in front of the player and stating that it
                    is an Operations Queue. Place an Operations Queue marker
                    on top of the card or cards played into the Queue.</p></div></div>
                <li class="liste_i"><strong>(ii.)</strong> On the player’s next Strategy Card play, he plays an
                    additional OPS Card into the Queue. He may then activate
                    a General with a Strategy Rating less than or equal to the
                    total value of the OPS Cards. Alternatively he may choose
                    to continue the Operations Queue.</li>
                <li class="liste_i"><strong>(iii.)</strong> When creating an Operations Queue, the player must
                    play each subsequent Strategy Card into the Queue until
                    he uses the Queue or abandons it. The Operations Queue
                    is abandoned if the player discards or plays any Strategy
                    Card to perform a different activity. (Note: This applies to
                    the sequential plays of Strategy Cards during the Strategy
                    Phase. Battle Cards played and other Event Strategy Cards
                    discarded during resolution of a battle do not cause abandonment
                    of the Operations Queue.) When an Operations
                    Queue has been completed (used to activate a General) or
                    abandoned, place all the OPS Cards face up on the discard
                    pile. <em> Discard of an OPS card to pick up a discarded Event
                    does not cancel the OPS Queue.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="exemple"><strong>Example:</strong> The British player holds a hand of three 1 OPS Cards,
                one 3 OPS Card and three event cards. During the course of the
                game turn he foresees the possible need to move Howe, Cornwallis
                and/or Burgoyne. As his first play, he places one of the 1 OPS
                Cards in front of him and starts an Operations Queue, placing an
                “Operations Queue” marker on top of it. The American player
                makes a routine play that does not change the British player’s
                plan. The British player then plays the second 1 OPS Card into
                the Operations Queue. The queue now totals two, so he activates
                Burgoyne for movement. After the move is completed, both 1 OPS
                Cards are placed in the Discard Pile.
            </p>
            <p class="exemple"><strong>Example:</strong>With the same starting situation as above, the American
                player takes an action that the British player believes must
                be responded to by playing one of his Event Strategy Cards as
                the event. He does so, but has interrupted his continual play of
                cards into the Operations Queue and thus abandoned it. The event
                is implemented but the 1 OPS Card in the Operations Queue is placed 
                in the discard pile. The British player may start a new
                Operations Queue with his next play.
            </p>
            <p class="exemple"><strong>Example:</strong>With the same starting situation as above, the Operations
                Queue has grown to hold two 1 OPS Cards. After the
                American’s second play, the British player decides he wishes to
                activate Cornwallis. Even though there are already two 1 OPS
                Cards in the queue, he must still play another card into the queue
                in order to activate a General. He cannot play an event and
                also activate Cornwallis, nor may he pass on playing a card to
                activate Cornwallis. He plays the remaining 1 OPS Card into the
                queue and now has three operations points, so he may activate
                any British General that he chooses.
            </p>
            <h3 id="7_2">7.2 Activating Generals with Campaign Cards</h3>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>A.</strong> By playing a “Major Campaign” Event Strategy Card, a
                    player may activate up to three of his Generals, regardless of
                    their Strategy Ratings. By playing a “Minor Campaign” Event
                    Strategy Card, he may activate up to two Generals (regardless
                    of their Strategy Ratings). The first General must finish
                    his entire activation (including any Battles he wishes to fight)
                    before the next General begins. A General cannot be activated
                    more than once in a Campaign, nor may a given CU be moved
                    by more than one General during a campaign. The player need
                    not announce which Generals will be activated when the card
                    is played; the player may move one General, and then select
                    which General he will activate next and so on until all Generals
                    have completed their activations.
                </li>
                <li><strong>B. Landing Party (British):</strong> With the play of any Campaign
                    Event Strategy Card, in lieu of activating one General, the
                    British player may either (a) flip an American PC marker in a
                    non-Blockaded port space not containing an American General,
                    CU, or the Continental Congress; or (b) place a British
                    PC marker in an empty, non-Blockaded port space. Neither
                    of these options may be employed in a fortified port space
                    (2.1.C). Only one Landing Party activation is allowed per play
                    of a Campaign Event Strategy Card.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="design_note"><strong>Design Note:</strong> Subsequent to flipping the American PC counter,
                the British player may use an additional activation during the
                same Campaign Event to make a British Naval Movement to
                that now friendly port.</p>
