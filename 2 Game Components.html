            <ul>
                <li>A. The map for Washington’s War covers the area of eastern
                    North America over which the Revolutionary War was fought.
                    The circles, squares and eight-point stars—called Spaces—represent
                    the major locations, and players move among, fight over,
                    and take control of these spaces. Armies may move between
                    adjacent spaces, i.e., the spaces joined by lines, and movement
                    takes place along those lines. The map is sub-divided into
                    Colonies, and the color coding of the spaces helps players keep
                    track of which spaces belong to each colony.
                </li>
                <li>B. Square spaces and eight-point star spaces serve as Winter
                    Quarters spaces. The line of snow flake symbols coincident
                    with the Virginia-North Carolina border is the Winter Attrition
                    Line. Both the Winter Attrition Line and Winter Quarters
                    spaces play a role in resolving Winter Attrition (
                <span><a href="11 winter attrition.html">11.0</a> </span>).
                </li>
                <li id="2_1_C">C. Spaces bearing a Port symbol are known as Port Spaces.
                    Quebec, Montreal, Charleston SC and Philadelphia PA are depicted
                    as eight-point stars. Such star-shaped spaces are defined
                    as fortified ports. Each of these ports historically was able to
                    resist naval actions in their vicinity. British Landing Parties (
            <a href="7 movement.html#7_2_B">7.2.B</a>) 
                    are not allowed in these spaces, and British Royal Navy Support (
            <a href="9 battles.html#9_42">9.42</a>) 
                    and Retreat by Sea (
            <a href="9 battles.html#9_62">9.62</a>) 
                    is possible only if the port is British Controlled (i.e., contains a British PC marker).

            <h3 id="2_2">2.2 The Playing Pieces (Counters and Markers)</h3>
            <p>Washington’s War uses two kinds of playing pieces: counters and
                markers. The counters represent Combat units and Generals. The
                markers provide a host of additional information.
            </p>
            <div class="image_imbriquee">
                <img src="images/illustration 2.2.A combat unit.gif" alt="combat unit">   
                <p>A. The round playing pieces are combat units
                    (CUs), colored and pictured to represent
                    American (blue), British (red), or French
                    (green) fighting forces. The number on these
                    counters represents that number of combat
                    units for that nationality, in denominations of 1, 2, 3 or 5. Feel
                    free at any time to “make change” freely with these counters:
                    for example, you may replace a “5” combat unit with two “2”s
                    and a “1”, or with five “1”s.
                </p>
            </div>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li>B. The large rectangular pieces are the Generals, which are
                    placed in the plastic stands included in the game so that they
                    stand up on the map. Each depicts a General important to the
                    conflict—American, British, or French. CUs may only move
                    when stacked with a General. For players who prefer them,
                    smaller square pieces are included for each General to be used
                    in lieu of the rectangular stand-up pieces.
                </li>

                <li>
                    At top left of a stand-up General counter is his
                    Strategy Rating. Strategy Ratings range from 1-3, and are used
                    in conjunction with the OPS Cards to activate Generals (and
                    their CUs) for movement (7.0). The number at top right is the
                    Generals Potential Battle Rating and are used in the Combat
                    Resolution Procedure (9.2). Potential Battle Ratings vary from
                    1-6 and are used as the basis for determining the General’s Actual
                    Battle Rating (and DRM) during combat resolution (9.3).
                    The number in the lower right is the General’s Agility Rating.
                    Agility Ratings vary from 1-3. The Agility Rating impacts the
                    possible losses the enemy may take during combat resolution
                    (9.5). For American Generals, the Agility Rating is also used
                    to resolve interception (7.8) and retreat before battle (7.9) attempts.
                    (Washington and Greene enjoy a special modification
                    to their Agility Rating when attempting retreat before battle.)

                    D. The Political Control (PC) markers are
                    shaped like hexagons and are placed in individual
                    spaces on the map to denote control of
                    that space. They are double-sided, representing
                    American control on one side and British control
                    on the reverse; they are flipped when
                    control of a space changes hands.
