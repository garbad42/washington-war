            <h1 class="titre_chapitre">3.0 TERMINOLOGY</h1>
            <p>The following terms are used throughout the rules and on Strategy
                Cards:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>Adjacent:</strong>Two spaces are said to be adjacent when they are
                    connected by a line.There are two types of lines which
                    connect spaces: normal, solid lines and dashed Wilderness
                    Connections; see 7.3.D. If the American General,
                    Arnold is in either Falmouth, MA or Quebec, Canada,
                    the other space is adjacent to Arnold only, traced along
                    the dashed Wilderness Connection. For purposes of PC
                    Isolation, British controlled ports are all considered adjacent
                    to each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Agility Rating:</strong>An expression of a General’s ability to maneuver
                    his Army in battle. The higher the rating, the (better)
                    the General’s ability to retreat or intercept an enemy
                    Army. The higher the rating, the more likely the winner
                    will take losses in a battle where the General is defeated.
                </li>
                <li><strong>American Unit:</strong>An American or French General, an
                    American or French CU, the Continental Congress or
                    any combination of these units. An American PC marker
                    does not count as an American Unit.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Army:</strong>A General with at least one friendly Combat Units in
                    a space.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Battle Card:</strong>A special subset of Event Strategy Cards.
                    When played as an event during the Combat Resolution
                    Procedure battle, the player receives certain benefitswhich may include a helpful DRM. Battle Card text also
                    directs the player to draw a replacement card from the
                    Strategy Deck (
            <a href="9 battles.html/9_45">9.45</a>).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Blockade Zone:</strong>A group of Port spaces comprise a “Blockade
                    Zone” (
            <a href="12 french alliance.html/#12_3">12.3</a>).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Blockaded Zone:</strong>A Blockaded Zone is a Blockade Zone
                    containing the French Navy (
            <a href="12 french alliance.html/#12_3">12.3</a>).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Colony:</strong>A grouping of one or more spaces on the map
                    makes up each colony and Canada. Every space belongs
                    to one of the thirteen American colonies or to Canada
                    and is color-coded to aid in identifying its colonial association.
                </li>

                    <p><strong>Combat Unit (CU):</strong>A combat unit represents approximatelya Brigade of soldiers. CUs have no ability to move except when moved in
                        conjunction with a General. CUs are treated like monetary change. Players
                        may exchange them at any time for any reason as long as the nationality and total
                        number of CUs in the space is not altered by the exchange.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <li><strong>Die Roll Modifier (DRM):</strong>When a battle occurs each
                    player rolls a six sided die as modified by a wide range
                    of DRMs. The higher modified value yields victory in
                    battle.</li>
                <li><strong>Event Strategy Card:</strong>A Strategy Card implementing
                    the effects of an important social, economic, political,
                    military or diplomatic event that historically occurred or
                    could have occurred. Event Strategy cards have nationspecific
                    flags next to their titles to help players determine
                    which side(s) may implement the event. The text of
                    the title is provided merely to provide historical color
                    and texture; it has no bearing on implementing the text.
                    When played (not discarded) the text on the card must be
                    implemented literally, exactly and completely; although
                    some cards do provide the player with options. Most
                    Event Strategy Cards may be discarded in lieu of being
                    played. There are seven Special Event Strategy Cardsthat 
                    must be played as the event regardless of which player draws them (
            <a href="6 strategy cards.html/#6_34">6.34</a>).
                </li>
                <li><strong>General:</strong>A General represents an important military leader
                    that participated in the war. Each General has a Strategy,
                    Agility and Potential Battle Rating.
                </li>
                <li><strong>OPS Card:</strong>A Strategy Card bearing a number 1, 2 or 3
                    at top left. Players play these cards during the Strategy
                    Phase in order to move Generals and any accompanying
                    CUs from space to space, or to place and flip PC markers
                    in spaces, or to bring reinforcements into the game.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Political Control:</strong>A player controls a space if he has one
                    of his Political Control (PC) markers in that space. This
                    is true even if an opposing CU or General also occupies
                    that space. Political Control of a space can change numerous
                    times over the course of a game.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Political Control Marker (PC):</strong>Hexagonal playing piece
                    which represents either American or British political
                    control of a space.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Potential Battle Rating:</strong>An expression of a General’s
                    potential tactical prowess in battle. The higher the rating,
                    the greater the probability that the General will contribute
                    die roll modifiers in battle and the higher the possible
                    Actual Battle Rating.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stacking Limits:</strong>There are no CU stacking limits; a space
                    may contain as many CUs as the owning player desires.
                    There is a limit of one General for each side to a space.
                    Except during the resolution of a battle, no space may
                    contain Generals and/or CUs of both sides.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Strategy Card:</strong>See Event Strategy Card and OPS Card.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Strategy Rating:</strong>A value that determines how easy it to activate
                    a General for movement. A “1 rated” General can
                    be activated by any value OPS card, a “2 rated” General
                    can be activated by a 2 or 3 value OPS card, and a “3
                    rated” General can be activated by 3 value OPS card.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stock:</strong>Combat Units not located on the map or in a Reinforcement
                    box constitute a player’s Combat Unit stock.
                    See
