            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>A.</strong> Political control of the colonies and Canada determines
                    who wins a game of Washington’s War. Political control is
                    determined by the number of PC markers in each colony. Each
                    space on the board may be in one of three states:</li>
            </ul>
                    <ul class="liste_puce_retrait">
                        <li>American control, denoted by an American PC marker;</li>
                        <li>British control, denoted by a British PC marker, or</li>
                        <li>Uncontrolled, denoted by the absence of a PC marker.</li>
                    </ul>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li>No space ever contains more than one PC marker.</li>
                <li><strong>B.</strong> Colonies are controlled by the side that has the majority
                    of PC markers in them. If both sides have equal numbers,
                    or if there are no PC markers in the colony, the colony is
                    uncontrolled. Canada is not a colony, but will count toward
                    achieving Victory Conditions 
        (<a href="13 victory.html">13.0</a>). To control Canada, the
                    controlling side must control both the Montreal and Quebec
                    spaces. Control of Fort Detroit is irrelevant in determining
                    control of Canada.</li>
                <li><strong>C.</strong> Players may place friendly PC markers and remove enemy
                    PC markers through play of Strategy Cards during the
                    Strategy Phase 
        (<a href="5 Sequence of play.html#5_3">5.3</a>). Players also place friendly PC markers
                    and remove enemy PC markers during certain activities of the
                    Political Phase 
        (<a href="5 Sequence of play.html#5_6">5.6</a>).</li>

                the Strategy Phase</h3>
            <h4 id="10_11">10.11 Placing and Flipping PC Markers with OPS Cards</h4>
            <p>Each side uses a slightly different mechanic for placing PC
                markers with OPS Cards.</p>
            <h4>A. American:</h4>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <div class="image_imbriquee">
                    <img src="images/PC marker american.gif" alt="PC marker American">
                    <li class="ligne_marge_gauche_réduite">(i.) To place or flip PC markers, the American
                        plays an OPS Card face up on the Discard
                        pile. The number on the OPS Card indicates
                        how many PC actions he may take, i.e., how
                        many PC markers he may potentially place
                        or flip. Example: If a 3 OPS Card is played
                        the American could place up to three American PC markers
                        or flip up to three British PC markers to the American side
                        or any combination of placing and flipping, subject to the
                        restrictions on both.</li>
                </div>
                <li>(ii.) As one PC action the American player can place an
                    American PC marker into any space not containing a PC
                    marker of either side nor containing a British CU. (<strong>Exception:</strong>
                    see iv below.)</li>
                <li id="10_11_A_iii">(iii.) As one PC action the American player may flip a British
                    PC marker to its American PC marker side if there is
                    an American General in the space. The American General
                    does not need to have any CUs in the space.<em><strong>Note:</strong>  Generals
                    without CUs may not move into a space with an enemy PC
        (<a href="7 movement.html#7_4">7.4</a>), so the situation where an American General is in a
                    space with a British PC only occurs through some indirect
                    combination of moves/events.</em></li>
                <li class="design_note"><strong>Design Note:</strong> This rule differs from the similar rule for the
                    British and gives the Americans a slight edge. It represents
                    the ability of the American leaders (political as well as
                    Generals) to revitalize the revolution in areas that were not
                    garrisoned by British troops.</li>
                <li>(iv.) <strong>Continental Congress dispersed (“Pennsylvania
                    and New Jersey Line Mutinies”):</strong> The American player
                    may not use OPS Cards or an Event discard to place PC
                    Markers if the Continental Congress is dispersed 
        (<a href="7 movement.html#7_7">7.7</a>) or
                    if the “Pennsylvania and New Jersey Line Mutinies” Event
                    Strategy Card has been played as the event during the current
                    turn. The Americans may still flip PC markers with an OPS
                    Card play (see iii above). The Americans can still remove
                    PC markers by discarding an Event card 
        (<a href="6 strategy cards.html#6_32_B_iii">6.32.B.iii</a>). The
                    Americans can still play Events to place PC markers.</li>
                <li class="clarification">
                        <h4>Continental Congress Dispersed Clarification</h4>
                        <p>In addition to the ability to use an OPS card to <em>flip</em> (but
                            not place) a PC under these conditions, the Americans
                            may <em>discard</em> an event to <em>flip</em> (but not place) a PC marker
                            as in 
        <a href="#10_11_A_iii">10.11.A.iii</a>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>B. British:</h4>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <div class="image_imbriquee">
                    <img src="images/PC marker british.gif." alt="PC marker british">
                    <li class="ligne_marge_gauche_réduite">(i.) To place or flip PC markers, the British
                        play an OPS Card face up on the Discard
                        pile. The number on the OPS Card indicates
                        how many PC actions he may take, i.e., how
                        many PC markers he may potentially place
                        or flip. <em><strong>Example:</strong> If a 2 OPS Card is played
                        the British could place up to two British PC markers or flip
                        up to two American PC markers to the British side or any
                        combination of placing and flipping, subject to the restrictions
                        on both.</em></li>
                </div>
                <li>(ii.) As one PC action the British player can <em>place</em> a British
                    PC marker into any space not containing a PC marker of
                    either side, nor containing an American Unit. <em><strong>Important:</strong></em> All
                    new British PC markers must be placed in spaces adjacent to
                    spaces already containing British PC markers. PC markers
                    newly placed or flipped as a result of a PC action taken with
                    the play of the current OPS Card do not satisfy the requirement
                    that new played British PC markers be placed adjacent
                    to existing British PC markers (i.e., no “daisy chaining”).</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="image_verticale_centree" src="images/exemple 10 PC marker placement.gif" alt="10 exemple pcmarker placement">
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><em><strong>Example:</strong> The British begin the game with a PC marker
                    in Montreal. The British player plays a 2 OPS Card and
                    declares he will use it to place PC markers. The first PC
                    marker is placed in Oswego which is adjacent to Montreal.
                    The second PC marker, however, may not be placed in Fort
                    Stanwix even though Fort Stanwix is adjacent to Oswego
                    since Oswego did not have a PC marker at the beginning
                    of the card play. The second PC marker will have to be
                    placed elsewhere.</em></li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> For the British, all ports are considered to be
                    adjacent to each other for all purposes regardless of the
                    placement of the French Navy if present.</li>
                <li>(iii.) As one PC action the British player may <u>place</u> a British
                    PC marker or <em>flip</em> an American PC marker to its British
                    PC marker side if there is a British Army (i.e., a General
                    and at least 1 CU) in the space. This action can take place
                    in any space; it need not be adjacent to an existing British
                    PC marker.</li>
                <li class="design_note"><strong>Design Note:</strong> This capability allows the British player to
                    move an Army into a new area, gain control of one space and
                    then, in subsequent card plays, begin placing PC markers
                    adjacent to the recently controlled space. This represents the
                    ability of the British Army to systematically pacify a region
                    through the use of selective arrests, local offers of amnesty,
                    seizure of armament stores and gaining political control of
                    local militias and community governments. Howe’s pacification
                    of New Jersey in the late summer and fall of 1776
                    provides an historical example.</li>

            <h4 id="10_12">10.12 Placing and Removing PC Markers with Event
                Strategy Cards</h4>
                <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                    <li><strong>A.</strong> During the Strategy Phase, Event Strategy Cards played as
                        events may allow for the placement or removal of PC markers.
                        The conditions pertaining to these events vary widely from card
                        to card so it is important to implement the text on the card specifically
                        and literally. For example an enemy PC marker may
                        not be flipped if the event text specifies “place PC markers”.
                        There are usually geographic constraints as well as restrictions
                        regarding the other counters that may be in the space.</li>
                    <li><strong>B.</strong> Event Strategy Cards may also be discarded per Rule 6.32
                        to allow one PC action to be taken on a space adjacent to a
                        current friendly PC marker. Important: The restriction that
                        the PC being placed or removed be adjacent to a friendly PC
                        applies to both sides in this case. That action may be to:</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="liste_puce_retrait">
                    <li>place or flip one PC adjacent to a friendly PC subject
                        to the additional restrictions for each side in itemized
                        in Rule 10.11, or</li>
                    <li>remove one enemy PC from a space which is adjacent
                        to a space containing a friendly PC counter and that is
                        not occupied by an enemy CU, an American General or
                        the Continental Congress.</li>

                <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                    <li>Play of any Campaign Event Strategy Card by the British
                    provides the option of executing a Landing Party which allows
                    the British player to place a British PC marker or flip an
                    American PC marker under certain circumstances; see

            <h3 id="10_2">10.2 The Political Control Phase</h3>
            <p>The Political Control Phase consists of three segments, executed
                in specific order:</p>
                <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                    <li><strong>1. Continental Congress Segment</strong></li>
                    <li class="liste_marge_gauche_augmentee">If the Continental Congress counter is in the Continental
                        Congress Dispersed Box, the American player must place
                        it in on the map, in any space in the Thirteen Colonies (not
                        Canada) containing an American PC Marker but no British
                        playing pieces. If there are no such spaces available, the
                        Continental Congress counter remains out of play until the Continental Congress Segment of the next Game-Turn. Note
                        that dispersing and subsequent placement in a different space
                        is the only way in which the Continental Congress counter
                        can change locations on the map.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Place PC Markers Segment</strong></li>
                    <li class="liste_marge_gauche_augmentee">Each player places a PC marker in any uncontrolled space
                        and flips to friendly control any enemy PC marker in any
                        space currently occupied by one of his Armies. British
                        players place/flip PC markers even in spaces which are not
                        adjacent to extant British PCs. Neither side may place PC
                        markers in spaces that are occupied by a friendly General
                        with no CUs nor occupied by CUs without a General.</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Remove Isolated PC Markers Segment</strong></li>
                    <li class="liste_marge_gauche_augmentee">The American player removes all of his PC markers that
                        are isolated as defined in Section 
            <a href="#10_3">10.3</a>. After all isolated
                        American PC markers have been removed, the British player
                        removes all of his PC markers that are isolated. Because the
                        American player removes PC markers first, British PC markers

                    Control Phase, each player, in turn, American player first,
