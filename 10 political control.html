                <li><strong>A.</strong> Political control of the colonies and Canada determines
                    who wins a game of Washington’s War. Political control is
                    determined by the number of PC markers in each colony. Each
                    space on the board may be in one of three states:</li>
            </ul>
                    <ul class="liste_puce_retrait">
                        <li>American control, denoted by an American PC marker;</li>
                        <li>British control, denoted by a British PC marker, or</li>
                        <li>Uncontrolled, denoted by the absence of a PC marker.</li>
                    </ul>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li>No space ever contains more than one PC marker.</li>
                <li><strong>B.</strong> Colonies are controlled by the side that has the majority
                    of PC markers in them. If both sides have equal numbers,
                    or if there are no PC markers in the colony, the colony is
                    uncontrolled. Canada is not a colony, but will count toward
                    achieving Victory Conditions 
        (<a href="13 victory.html">13.0</a>). To control Canada, the
                    controlling side must control both the Montreal and Quebec
                    spaces. Control of Fort Detroit is irrelevant in determining
                    control of Canada.</li>
                <li><strong>C.</strong> Players may place friendly PC markers and remove enemy
                    PC markers through play of Strategy Cards during the
                    Strategy Phase 
        (<a href="5 Sequence of play.html#5_3">5.3</a>). Players also place friendly PC markers
                    and remove enemy PC markers during certain activities of the
                    Political Phase 
        (<a href="5 Sequence of play.html#5_6">5.6</a>).</li>
            </ul>

                the Strategy Phase</h3>
            <h4 id="10_11">10.11 Placing and Flipping PC Markers with OPS Cards</h4>
            <p>Each side uses a slightly different mechanic for placing PC
                markers with OPS Cards.</p>
            <h4>A. American:</h4>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <div class="image_imbriquee">
                    <img src="images/PC marker american.gif" alt="PC marker American">
                    <li class="ligne_marge_gauche_réduite">(i.) To place or flip PC markers, the American
                        plays an OPS Card face up on the Discard
                        pile. The number on the OPS Card indicates
                        how many PC actions he may take, i.e., how
                        many PC markers he may potentially place
                        or flip. Example: If a 3 OPS Card is played
                        the American could place up to three American PC markers
                        or flip up to three British PC markers to the American side
                        or any combination of placing and flipping, subject to the
                        restrictions on both.</li>
                </div>
                <li>(ii.) As one PC action the American player can place an
                    American PC marker into any space not containing a PC
                    marker of either side nor containing a British CU. (<strong>Exception:</strong>
                    see iv below.)</li>
                <li id="10_11_A_iii">(iii.) As one PC action the American player may flip a British
                    PC marker to its American PC marker side if there is
                    an American General in the space. The American General
                    does not need to have any CUs in the space.<em><strong>Note:</strong>  Generals
                    without CUs may not move into a space with an enemy PC
        (<a href="7 movement.html#7_4">7.4</a>), so the situation where an American General is in a
                    space with a British PC only occurs through some indirect
                    combination of moves/events.</em></li>
                <li class="design_note"><strong>Design Note:</strong> This rule differs from the similar rule for the
                    British and gives the Americans a slight edge. It represents
                    the ability of the American leaders (political as well as
                    Generals) to revitalize the revolution in areas that were not
                    garrisoned by British troops.</li>
                <li>(iv.) <strong>Continental Congress dispersed (“Pennsylvania
                    and New Jersey Line Mutinies”):</strong> The American player
                    may not use OPS Cards or an Event discard to place PC
                    Markers if the Continental Congress is dispersed 
        (<a href="7 movement.html#7_7">7.7</a>) or
                    if the “Pennsylvania and New Jersey Line Mutinies” Event
                    Strategy Card has been played as the event during the current
                    turn. The Americans may still flip PC markers with an OPS
                    Card play (see iii above). The Americans can still remove
                    PC markers by discarding an Event card 
        (<a href="6 strategy cards.html#6_32_B_iii">6.32.B.iii</a>). The
                    Americans can still play Events to place PC markers.</li>
                <li class="clarification">
                        <h4>Continental Congress Dispersed Clarification</h4>
                        <p>In addition to the ability to use an OPS card to <em>flip</em> (but
                            not place) a PC under these conditions, the Americans
                            may <em>discard</em> an event to <em>flip</em> (but not place) a PC marker
                            as in 
        <a href="#10_11_A_iii">10.11.A.iii</a>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>B. British:</h4>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <div class="image_imbriquee">
                    <img src="images/PC marker british.gif." alt="PC marker british">
                    <li class="ligne_marge_gauche_réduite">(i.) To place or flip PC markers, the British
                        play an OPS Card face up on the Discard
                        pile. The number on the OPS Card indicates
                        how many PC actions he may take, i.e., how
                        many PC markers he may potentially place
                        or flip. <em><strong>Example:</strong> If a 2 OPS Card is played
                        the British could place up to two British PC markers or flip
                        up to two American PC markers to the British side or any
                        combination of placing and flipping, subject to the restrictions
                        on both.</em></li>
                </div>
                <li>(ii.) As one PC action the British player can <em>place</em> a British
                    PC marker into any space not containing a PC marker of
                    either side, nor containing an American Unit. <em><strong>Important:</strong></em> All
                    new British PC markers must be placed in spaces adjacent to
                    spaces already containing British PC markers. PC markers
                    newly placed or flipped as a result of a PC action taken with
                    the play of the current OPS Card do not satisfy the requirement
                    that new played British PC markers be placed adjacent
                    to existing British PC markers (i.e., no “daisy chaining”).</li>
