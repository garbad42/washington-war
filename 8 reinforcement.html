            <p>During the Reinforcement Phase (
        <a href="5 Sequence of play.html#5_1">5.1</a>), captured Generals are
                repatriated and potential reinforcing British CUs are determined.
                Bringing on reinforcements during the Strategy Phase is optional.
                Neither player is required to do so.</p>
            <h3 id="8_1">8.1 British Reinforcements</h3>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>A.</strong> During the Reinforcements Phase, the British player transfers
                    all of his Generals currently in the Captured Generals
                    Box into his Reinforcements Box. He also places, from the
                    counter mix, the number of CUs equal to the number showing
                    in the current space on the Game Turn Record Track into the
                    Reinforcement Box. These CUs are added to any British CUs
                    currently in the Reinforcement Box. There is no limit to how
                    many or how long British CUs can remain in the Reinforcements
                    Box.
                </li>
                <li><strong>B.</strong> Once during the Strategy Phase of each game-turn, the
                    British player may bring on reinforcements by playing an
                    OPS Card, of any value, into the British Reinforcement Card
                    Box. Placing the OPS Card in the box serves as mnemonic to
                    both players that the British have conducted their reinforcement
                    activity.</li>
                <li><strong>C.</strong> To bring on reinforcements the British player transfers
                    any number of CUs from the British Reinforcements Box to
                    any one non-Blockaded Port space that does not contain an
                    American CU or PC marker. The British player may, but need
                    not, transfer one of his Generals from the Reinforcements Box
                    to that space. If a British General is already in the space and a
                    new General is brought on, the old General is removed to the
                    Reinforcements Box.
                </li>
            </ul><br>
            <p><em><strong>Clarification:</strong></em> The General and all CUs desired (some may be
                left in the Reinforcement Box) all arrive in the same eligible port
                space. More than 5 CUs may be brought on if desired, and the
                British may add these reinforcing CUs to any number of CUs
                already in the space.</p>
            <h3 id="8_2">8.2 American Reinforcements</h3>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>A.</strong> During the Reinforcements Phase (
        <a href="5 Sequence of play.html#5_1">5.1</a>), the American Player
                    transfers any American Generals currently in the Captured
                    Generals Box to his Reinforcements Box.
                </li>
                <li><strong>B.</strong> Twice during the Strategy Phase of each game-turn, the
                    American player may bring on reinforcements by playing
                    an OPS Card, of any value, into one of the two American
                    Reinforcement Card Boxes. Placing the OPS Card into a box
                    serves as mnemonic to both players that the Americans have
                    conducted one of their two possible reinforcement activities.
                </li>
                <li><strong>C.</strong> To bring on reinforcements, the American player transfers,
                    from stock, as many CUs as the number on the OPS Card (i.e.,
                    with a 3 OPS Card, 3 CUs) to a single space (just one space
                    guys, doesnâ€™t matter how many OPS you spend or how many
                    CUs you place, you can only stick them all in one single,
                    space) that does not contain a British CU or PC marker. Additionally
                    he may also transfer to the same space a General
                    from the American Reinforcement Box. If there is an American
                    General already in the space, then the new General takes his
                    place and the old General is returned to the Reinforcement
                    Box. The replaced General may be brought back on during a
                    subsequent reinforcement activity even during the same Game-
                    Turn. Washington may never be sent to the Reinforcement Box,
                    so if CUs are brought on to reinforce
                </li>
            </ul><br>  
                <p><em><strong>Clarification:</strong></em> PC marker status permitting, either player may
                    place reinforcements into a space which contains an enemy
                    General with no CUs. In such a case the General is captured.
