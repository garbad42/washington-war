            <h1 class="titre_chapitre">9.0 BATTLES</h1>

            <p>Combat is resolved in two stages. First the winner of the battle is
                determined by modified competitive die rolls. Once the winner is
                ascertained, the number of CUs lost by each side is determined
                and, unless one side is entirely eliminated, the loser executes a
                retreat. Combat die rolls are modified by Army strengths, Generals’
                tactical abilities, Battle Cards and a number of other factors.
            </p>

            <h3 id="9_1">9.1 Battle Definition</h3>
            <p>A battle occurs when an activated General and his Army are in a
                space with enemy CUs after any interception and retreat before
                battle attempts have been resolved. Under some conditions an
                Overrun (
        <a href="#9_7">9.7</a>) may occur instead, in which case the activated
                General and his Army may continue moving. The activated
                General and his Army are always considered the attacker, even
                if an interception attempt was successful and resulted in a battle
                unplanned by the activating player.
            </p>
            <p class="design_note" id="note_battles"><strong>Design Note:</strong> The intercepting force is placed into the space
                before the attacking force arrives, which causes the battle. The
                intercepting force remains the defender, but one who selected
                the actual field of combat and usually was able to prepare positions
                and surprise the attacker. Two clear historical examples
                occurred at Monmouth and Cowpens. Interceptions only occur
                on American PC Markers which represents both the lack of Tory
                guides and the presence of rebel irregulars who interfered with
                British reconnaissance and intelligence gathering.
            </p>

            <h3 id="9_2">9.2 Combat Resolution Procedure</h3>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> The attacker declares and plays a Battle Card or
                    discards an Event Strategy Card (
        <a href="6 strategy cards.html#6_33">6.33</a>) if he wishes to do
                    so. Then the defender may play a Battle Card or discard an
                    Event Strategy Card. Each player may only play or discard
                    one card. <em><strong>(Special:</strong> If the “Benedict Arnold Treason!” event
                    is played (not discarded by the American player), take all the
                    actions specified on the card immediately. If the conditions for
                    an overrun now exist, conduct an overrun procedure in lieu
                    of continuing the battle procedure. Note that Arnold may be
                    removed from the battle space or from some other location on
                    the board. If Arnold is removed from the battle, the American
                    force, even if attacking, continues the battle.)</em></li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Each player rolls a die to determine his General’s
                    Actual Battle Rating for this battle; see 
        <a href="#table_9_3">Table 9.3</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> The players determine and agree on the total die roll
                    modifiers (DRM) for each side using the procedures specified
                    in section 
        <a href="#9_4">9.4</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Each player rolls a die and adds to it the DRM for
                    their side. If the attacker’s total is greater than or equal to the
                    defender’s total, the attacker wins the battle.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> The CU losses to both sides are determined using the
                    procedures specified in section 
        <a href="#9_5">9.5</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The losing side, which may consist only of a General
                    if the losses were great enough, conducts a retreat using the
                    procedures specified in 
        <a href="#9_6">9.6</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> If the Americans win, advance the French Alliance
                    Marker by one space (
        <a href="12 french alliance.html#12_1">12.1</a>). If the British lose 3 CUs or more,
                    including through Surrender (
        <a href="#9_63">9.63</a>), flip the Turn Counter to the
                    “No British Regulars Advantage” side if the British Regulars
                    Advantage is still in effect.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="9_3">9.3 Determining a General’s Actual Battle Ratings</h3>
            <p>A General’s Potential Battle Rating depicts the range of performance
                that General and his subordinates may have during a
                particular Battle. For each General, roll a die. On a die roll of
                1-3, the General’s Battle Rating is halved (round fractions down);
                on a die roll of 4-6, the General receives his full, printed Battle
                Rating. <strong>Important Exception:</strong> A General’s Actual Battle Rating
                can <em>never</em> be greater than the number of friendly CUs stacked
                with him. If there is no General in the battle, then the Actual
                Battle Rating is automatically zero. The Actual Battle Ratings
                are included in each side’s calculation of the combat DRM as
                described below.</p>

                <p>  During set up of the game, the Game-Turn
                    marker is placed with the British “Regulars” side
                    face up on the Game Turn Record Track. The
                    British receive a +1 DRM in all battles until the
                    British Regulars’ Advantage is lost. The British
                    Regulars’ Advantage is lost immediately if the British lose 3 or
                    more CUs in a single battle or through Surrender (
        <a href="#9_63">9.63</a>). 
                    The British may also lose the British Regulars’ Advantage as a result

                    the Game-Turn marker to the “No Regulars” side
                    for the remainder of the game. If the British
                    Regulars’ Advantage is lost during one of the

                provide a +2 DRM. A discarded Event Strategy Card provides a
                +1 DRM. (Reminder: It should be noted that Rule 6.33 does not
                permit the retrieval of an Event Strategy Card discarded for the
                purposes of gaining a +1 DRM in battle.) Event Strategy Cards
                used for this purpose apply only to a single battle even during
                activations caused by a Major/Minor Campaign Event. In the
                event that Battle Cards were played during battles generated by
                a Major/Minor Campaign Event, delay drawing cards pursuant to
                the cards’ instructions until after all activations of the campaign
                have been completed.</p>

                <h4 id="9_46">9.46 Interception Bonus</h4>
                <p>The American side receives a +1 DRM if there was a successful

                <div class="combat_losses">
                <p>During Step 5 of the Combat Resolution Procedures, both sides
                    determine their losses.</p>
                <p>The loser of the battle rolls a die:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>on a die roll of 1, 2 or 3, 1 CU is lost;</li>
                    <li>on a die roll of 4 or 5, 2 CUs are lost;</li>
                    <li>on a die roll of 6, 3 CUs are lost.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The winner of the battle rolls a die:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the losing side had no General, the winning side loses
                        1 CU if the die roll is 1.</li>
                    <li>If the losing General has an Agility Rating of 1, the
                        winning side loses 1 CU if the die roll is 1-2.</li>
                    <li>If the losing General has an Agility Rating of 2, the
                        winning side loses 1 CU if the die roll is 1-3.</li>
                    <li>If the losing General has an Agility Rating of 3, the
                        winning side loses 1 CU if the die roll is 1-4.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em><strong>Special:</strong></em> Casualties could potentially leave a winning General
                    with no CUs. In such a case, if the General is on a space containing
                    a friendly PC marker or on an uncontrolled space he remains
                    on the map with no CUs; but if he is located in a space with an
                    enemy PC marker, he is captured.</p>

                <h4 id="9_61">9.61 Retreat Mechanics</h4>
                <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                    <li><strong>A.</strong> The losing General and Army must retreat to an adjacent
                        space that is not occupied by an enemy CU nor an enemy PC
                        marker. If this basic requirement cannot be satisfied, the losing
                        General and Army must Surrender 
        (<a href="#9_63">9.63</a>).</li>
                    <li><strong>B.</strong> Subject to the basic retreat requirements, if the attacker
                        loses the battle, the surviving General and Army must retreat
                        into the space from which it entered the battle. If the defender
                        loses the battle the surviving General and Army may retreat
                        into any space other than the one from which the attack originated.
                        The retreating force may not be split up; all must retreat
                        to the same space. A defending Army which intercepted into
                        the battle space is not required to retreat into the space from
                        which it intercepted.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p> Surviving Combat Units (attacker or defender) without a
                        General may retreat after losing a battle (such British CUs
                        may retreat by sea if otherwise eligible). Note that the attacker
                        could be left without a General if Benedict Arnold
                        is the attacking General and the Benedict Arnold event is
                        played as a Battle Card by the defender.</p>
                </div>

                <h4 id="9_62">9.62 British Retreat By Sea</h4>
                <p>A defending British General and any surviving CUs that lose a
                    battle in a port space may be able to retreat by sea. Retreat by
                    sea is only allowed if the battle space is not a blockaded port and
                    is not a fortified port (Charleston SC, Philadelphia PA, Quebec,
                    or Montreal) without a British PC marker in it. The retreating
                    force may retreat to any other non-Blockaded port that does not
                    contain an American CU or PC marker. The British player may
                    choose to retreat by sea even if other legal retreat options exist.
                    Note that the British may not retreat by sea when they are the
                    attacker because the attacker must retreat to the space from which
                    they entered the battle. American and French Generals and CUs
                    can never retreat by sea.</p>

                <h4 id="9_63">9.63 Surrenders</h4>
                <p>If a General and surviving CUs cannot conduct a legal retreat,
                    they must Surrender. CUs that Surrender are eliminated, while
                    Surrendering Generals are captured. Place the General counter
                    into the Captured Generals Box on the map board; see 
        <a href="7 movement.html#7_6">7.6</a>.</p>
                <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                    <li><strong>A.</strong> If the attacker enters the battle from a space that contains
                        an enemy PC marker and loses, then the attacking Army must
                        Surrender since it must retreat back to the space from which it
                        entered the Battle and that space contains an enemy PC marker.</li>
                    <li><strong>B.</strong> The defending General and any surviving CUs must Surrender

                    <li>a retreat by sea is not possible, and</li>
                    <li>the only remaining space is the space from which the

                <p class="battle_design_note"><strong>Design Note:</strong> Moving an Army into battle from an enemy controlled
                    space is very risky because if you lose the battle the
                    Army will have to Surrender. Effectively this is what happened
                    to General Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga.</p>
                <img class="image_verticale_centree" src="images/illustration 9.63 battle example.gif" alt="9 battle example">
                <p><em><strong>Combat Example:</strong> General Burgoyne and 5 CUs march into
                    Saratoga by way of Ticonderoga. American General Gates and
                    5 American CUs are in Saratoga. Not wishing to retreat before
                    battle, Gates stands and fights. The British discard an Event card
                    to gain a +1 DRM. The Americans play Battle Event, “Morgan’s
                    Riflemen” for a +2 DRM. Next, each General rolls a die to determine
                    their Actual Battle Rating. Burgoyne rolls a “4” and receives
                    his full, printed Battle Rating of “2” for a +2 DRM. Gates rolls
                    a “1” and receives only half of his printed Battle Rating for a +1
                    DRM.” Next, both players determine their combat DRMs: The
                    British get +5 for their 5 CUs, +2 for General Burgoyne’s Battle
                    Rating (determined above), +1 for the British Regulars bonus
                    (which is still in effect), and +1 for the discard of an Event card
                    for a total of +9. The Americans get +5 for their 5 CUs, +1 for
                    Gates’ Battle Rating (determined above), +1 for the militia of New
                    York (the Americans control more PC markers in the Colony), and
                    +2 for the play of the Battle Event for a total of +9. Each player
                    then rolls a die and adds their Combat DRM: The British roll a
                    “3” which is modified to 12. The Americans roll a “4” which is
                    modified to “13.” The attacker’s modified die roll must be greater
                    than or equal to the defender’s modified die roll in order to be
                    victorious. In this case, the attacker’s modified roll is less than
                    the defender’s modified roll so the Americans win! Next, combat
                    losses must be determined. The British lost the battle so they roll
                    a die and consult the Combat Losses Chart 
            (<a href="9_5">9.5</a>). Rolling a “5”
                    they lose 2 CUs and must retreat. The Americans must check to
                    see if they suffer any losses. Noting the losing General’s Agility
                    Rating (Burgoyne has an Agility of “1”), the Americans roll a die
                    and consult the Combat Losses Chart 
            (<a href="9_5">9.5</a>). Rolling a “2” the
                    Americans find they lose 1 CU. Note that the winner will never
                    lose more than 1 CU and will often times not suffer any losses.
                    Now the losing General must retreat what is left of his Army. Since
                    Burgoyne was the attacker and must retreat, he must retreat to the
                    space from which he entered combat—in this case, Ticonderoga.
                    Unfortunately, this space is American-controlled. This results
                    in Burgoyne surrendering the remainder of his Army. Burgoyne
                    is placed in the “Captured Generals” box and his 3 CUs are
                    removed from the map and placed back into the player’s stock.
                    Since the British lost 3 or more CUs in this battle, the British lose
                    their “Regulars” advantage for the remainder of the game. The
                    Turn marker is flipped on the Turn track to note this. The French
                    Alliance marker is adjusted +1 for the American victory and +2
                    for the loss of the British Regulars.</em></p>

                <h3 id="9_7">9.7 Overruns</h3>
                <p>An overrun occurs when an activated General with either 4 or 5
                    CUs enters a space occupied by 1 enemy CU without a General.
                    The moving Army declares an overrun, removes the enemy CU,
                    and if it has any remaining movement may continue. Any interception
                    attempts are resolved before the overrun is conducted.
                    After a successful overrun the activated Army does not roll for
                    losses. If a defending General is present or there is more than 1
                    CU present, the attacking Army must end its movement and a
                    battle occurs. (Clarification: If the Arnold counter is removed as
                    a result of play of the “Benedict Arnold Treason!” Battle Card,
                    the General is removed as Step 1 of the Combat Resolution
                    Procedure. If at that time only 1 American CU remains, and the
                    British are attacking with either 4 or 5 CUs, an overrun occurs.
                    If the Americans are attacking when Arnold is removed, even
                    with 4 or 5 CUs, an overrun does not occur and battle results).</p>
