            <h1 class="titre_chapitre">9.0 BATTLES</h1>

            <img class="image_verticale_centree" src="images/illustration haut de page 9.0 battles.gif"alt="haut de page 9.0 battles">
            <p>Combat is resolved in two stages. First the winner of the battle is
                determined by modified competitive die rolls. Once the winner is
                ascertained, the number of CUs lost by each side is determined
                and, unless one side is entirely eliminated, the loser executes a
                retreat. Combat die rolls are modified by Army strengths, Generals’
                tactical abilities, Battle Cards and a number of other factors.
            </p>

            <h3 id="9_1">9.1 Battle Definition</h3>
            <p>A battle occurs when an activated General and his Army are in a
                space with enemy CUs after any interception and retreat before
                battle attempts have been resolved. Under some conditions an
                Overrun (
        <a href="#9_7">9.7</a>) may occur instead, in which case the activated
                General and his Army may continue moving. The activated
                General and his Army are always considered the attacker, even
                if an interception attempt was successful and resulted in a battle
                unplanned by the activating player.
            </p>
            <p class="design_note" id="note_battles"><strong>Design Note:</strong> The intercepting force is placed into the space
                before the attacking force arrives, which causes the battle. The
                intercepting force remains the defender, but one who selected
                the actual field of combat and usually was able to prepare positions
                and surprise the attacker. Two clear historical examples
                occurred at Monmouth and Cowpens. Interceptions only occur
                on American PC Markers which represents both the lack of Tory
                guides and the presence of rebel irregulars who interfered with
                British reconnaissance and intelligence gathering.
            </p>

            <h3 id="9_2">9.2 Combat Resolution Procedure</h3>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> The attacker declares and plays a Battle Card or
                    discards an Event Strategy Card (
        <a href="6 strategy cards.html#6_33">6.33</a>) if he wishes to do
                    so. Then the defender may play a Battle Card or discard an
                    Event Strategy Card. Each player may only play or discard
                    one card. <em><strong>(Special:</strong> If the “Benedict Arnold Treason!” event
                    is played (not discarded by the American player), take all the
                    actions specified on the card immediately. If the conditions for
                    an overrun now exist, conduct an overrun procedure in lieu
                    of continuing the battle procedure. Note that Arnold may be
                    removed from the battle space or from some other location on
                    the board. If Arnold is removed from the battle, the American
                    force, even if attacking, continues the battle.)</em></li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Each player rolls a die to determine his General’s
                    Actual Battle Rating for this battle; see 
        <a href="#table_9_3">Table 9.3</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> The players determine and agree on the total die roll
                    modifiers (DRM) for each side using the procedures specified
                    in section 
        <a href="#9_4">9.4</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Each player rolls a die and adds to it the DRM for
                    their side. If the attacker’s total is greater than or equal to the
                    defender’s total, the attacker wins the battle.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> The CU losses to both sides are determined using the
                    procedures specified in section 
        <a href="#9_5">9.5</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The losing side, which may consist only of a General
                    if the losses were great enough, conducts a retreat using the
                    procedures specified in 
        <a href="#9_6">9.6</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> If the Americans win, advance the French Alliance
                    Marker by one space (
        <a href="12 french alliance.html#12_1">12.1</a>). If the British lose 3 CUs or more,
                    including through Surrender (
        <a href="#9_63">9.63</a>), flip the Turn Counter to the
                    “No British Regulars Advantage” side if the British Regulars
                    Advantage is still in effect.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="9_3">9.3 Determining a General’s Actual Battle Ratings</h3>
            <p>A General’s Potential Battle Rating depicts the range of performance
                that General and his subordinates may have during a
                particular Battle. For each General, roll a die. On a die roll of
                1-3, the General’s Battle Rating is halved (round fractions down);
                on a die roll of 4-6, the General receives his full, printed Battle
                Rating. <strong>Important Exception:</strong> A General’s Actual Battle Rating
                can <em>never</em> be greater than the number of friendly CUs stacked
                with him. If there is no General in the battle, then the Actual
                Battle Rating is automatically zero. The Actual Battle Ratings
                are included in each side’s calculation of the combat DRM as
                described below.</p>

                <img src="images/illustration 9.41 regulars.gif" alt="9.41 regular">
                <p>  During set up of the game, the Game-Turn
                    marker is placed with the British “Regulars” side
                    face up on the Game Turn Record Track. The
                    British receive a +1 DRM in all battles until the
                    British Regulars’ Advantage is lost. The British
                    Regulars’ Advantage is lost immediately if the British lose 3 or
                    more CUs in a single battle or through Surrender (
        <a href="#9_63">9.63</a>). 
                    The British may also lose the British Regulars’ Advantage as a result
                    of the play of the “Baron Von Steuben Trains the Continental
                    Army” Strategy Event Card.

                <p>When the British Regulars’ Advantage is lost, flip
                    the Game-Turn marker to the “No Regulars” side
                    for the remainder of the game. If the British
                    Regulars’ Advantage is lost during one of the
                    activations of a Major/Minor Campaign event, the
                    advantage is lost immediately and will apply during any subsequent
                    battles caused by the remaining activations of the campaign.
                    When the British lose the British Regulars’ Advantage,
                    also advance the French Alliance marker by 2 spaces (unless
