            <p>During the Strategy Phase, all activity depends on the play of
            Strategy cards. This includes moving Armies and fighting battles
            as well as taking control of spaces (by placing PC markers),
            bringing in reinforcements, and causing events to happen. The
            first three actions occur by playing the OPS Cards, while events
            occur by playing the Event Strategy Cards.
            </p>
            <h3 id="6_1">6.1 Dealing Strategy Cards and Reshuffling the Strategy Card Deck</h3>
            <p>In the Strategy Cards Phase of each game-turn, starting with the
            American player, both players are dealt a hand of seven Strategy
            Cards from the top of the Strategy Deck. These seven cards
            constitute each player’s hand.
            </p>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li>A. When the Strategy Deck is fully depleted, including the
                situation where a Strategy Card deal is interrupted, reconstitute
                the Strategy Card deck as described below, and resume
                dealing if appropriate.</li>
                <li>B. The Strategy Card Deck is reconstituted when either an
                Event Strategy Card is played (not discarded) that requires the
                Strategy Card Deck to be reshuffled or when the Strategy Card
                deck is depleted. In every case all the discards and any cards
                remaining in the Strategy Card deck are shuffled to constitute
                a fresh Strategy Card deck. Only the current “Lord North’s
                Government Falls — War Ends” card and any Event Strategy
                cards that have been permanently removed from play due to
                the instruction on the card are excluded from the shuffle.
                Reshuffle Clarification
                If a reshuffle is triggered in the middle of the Strategy Phase
                (owing to deck depletion and a card draw is needed from
                the play of a Battle Card Event), the current “War Ends”
                card and any cards currently in the Reinforcement Card
                boxes are not shuffled.
                The “Declaration of Independence” (#99) and “William Pitt
                Urges Peace Talks” (#95) event cards trigger a Reshuffle
                when played as an event (not discarded) as per the rulebook—
                of course “Declaration of Independence can never
                be discarded. The “Hortelez et Cie” (#96) event, however
                is the opposite: “Hortelez et Cie” triggers a Reshuffle when
                discarded (not played) as per the card text.</li>
                <li>C. Either player may examine the cards in the Discard Pile at
                any time. Neither player may examine the cards in the Strategy
                Card Deck.</li>
                <li>D. Certain event cards may change the constitution of either
                player’s hand, as explained on the card itself. For example,
                if the American Player plays the “John Paul Jones Shipping
                Raids” event, one card is randomly drawn from the British
                player’s hand and is discarded.</li>
                <li>E. SPECIAL RULE: “Declaration of Independence” and
                “Baron Von Steuben Trains the Continental Army” Cards:
                During the initial setup of the game, the “Declaration of Independence”
                and “Baron Von Steuben Trains the Continental
                Army” cards are set aside; see 4.0. At the beginning of the 1776
                turn, shuffle both cards into the Strategy Card deck. This is not
                a re-shuffle per se, so the discards remain discarded unless an
                event requiring a reshuffle is played (or the French Alliance
                comes into effect) in 1775.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="6_2">6.2 Playing the OPS Cards</h3>
            <p>Most of the game play revolves around the use of OPS Cards.
            These cards let players conduct their military campaigns and take
            control of spaces and colonies. Each time a player plays an OPS
            Card, he may do one (and only one) of the following:
            </p>
            <p class="exemple">Example: If “William Pitt Peace Talks” is in a player’s hand
                after the French Alliance has occurred, then it must be discarded
                as described in this section or in section 6.33.
            </p>
            <ul class="liste_avec_puce">
                <li>Activate a General for movement, with or without
                Combat Units under his command. Activation can occur
                only if the General’s Strategy Rating is equal to or
                less than the number on the card. An OPS Card showing
                a “3” can therefore activate any General, while an
                OPS Card with a “1” can activate only a General who
                has a Strategy Rating of 1. The OPS Card with a “2”
                can activate Generals with Strategy Ratings of 2, or 1,
                but not 3.</li>
                <li>Add a number of PC Markers to the map equal to the
                number on the OPS Card. See 
            <span><a href="10 political control.html/#10_1">10.1</a></span> for details.</li>
                <li>Bring on Reinforcements. See 
            <span><a href="8 reinforcement.html/#8_0">8.0</a></span> for details.</li>
                <li>Place that number of Operations into an Operations
                Queue. See 
            <span><a href="7 movement.html/#7_1_B">7.1.B</a></span> for details.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>OPS Cards used for placing PC counters or moving
            Generals and Armies are played by placing
            the card face up on the Discard Pile. Those used
            to bring on reinforcements are placed face up in
            one of that side’s Reinforcement Card boxes to
            record that a reinforcement action has occurred. Those cards
            used to begin or extend an Operations Queue are played face-up,
            under an “Operations Queue” marker in front of the player until
            the Queue is used to activate a General or the Queue is abandoned.
            Once the Queue is used or abandoned all the OPS Cards
            associated with it are placed face up in the Discard Pile.</p>

            <h4 id="6_32">6.32 Discarding Event Strategy Cards</h4>
            <p>A. Except for Special Event Strategy Cards that must be played
                as events, either player may choose to discard an Event Strategy
                Card rather than play it to implement the event. British
                players must discard Event Strategy Cards which have an
                American flag next to the title; American players must discard
                Event Strategy Cards which have a British flag next to the title.
                If the conditions specified in the card text cannot be met, then
                the card must be discarded. A card which is discarded is never
                removed from the game.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>B. When a player discards an Event Strategy Card as his play
            during the Strategy Phase, he also takes one of the following
            actions:
            </p>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li>(i.) The card is simply discarded and no further action is taken; or</li>
                <li>(ii.) Place or flip one PC adjacent to a friendly PC subject to the additional restrictions in Rule 10.11; or</li>
                <li>(iii.) Remove one enemy PC from a space which is adjacent to a space containing a friendly PC counter and that is not
                occupied by an enemy CU, an American General or the Continental Congress.</li>
            </ul>
                opponent’s PC marker. Only an Event card (even a friendly
                Event, but not a Special Event) can be discarded to remove
                a PC marker.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p id="6_32_C">C. If a player discards an Event Strategy Card as a play during
                the Strategy Phase (i.e., not as a Battle Card as described
                below), his opponent may exchange an OPS Card in his hand
                with the discarded Event Strategy Card before he takes his
                turn. Note that this action does not change the total number of
                cards in the exchanging player’s hand, nor does it constitute
                taking his turn.
            </p>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li>The American player must exchange either a 2 or 3
                    value OPS Card to retrieve such a discarded Event
                    Strategy Card.</li>
                <li>The British player must exchange any OPS Card, regardless
                    of value, to retrieve a discarded Event Strategy
                    Card.</li>
            </ul>
                <p class="exemple">Example: It is the British player turn. The British player discards
                    the “Henry Knox Continental Artillery Commander”
                    Event Strategy Card. He chooses to place a PC marker on the
                    board. After the British turn and before taking his turn, the
                    American player discards a 2 OPS Card from his hand and
                    exchanges it to bring the discarded “Henry Knox” card which
                    he places into his hand. It is now the American player’s turn.
                </p>
                <h4 id="6_33">6.33 Event Strategy Cards as Battle Cards</h4>
                <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li>A. Event Strategy Cards with the title printed in a colored box
                    are called Battle Cards. These events can only be implemented
                    when the card is played during the resolution of a battle (
                <span><a href="9 battles.html/#9_45">9.45</a></span>).
                    (Exception: “Banastre Tarleton Waxhaws Massacre” provides
                    the British player with the option to play the card as an event
                    during the Strategy Phase.) Once the battle is resolved, the
                    card is discarded (Exception: “Benedict Arnold Treason!” is
                    permanently removed). The +2 Battle DRM advantage applies
                    only to the battle underway when the card is played; i.e., if
                    more than one battle occurs during the turn as the result of a
                    Major or Minor Campaign event the Battle Card only modifies
                    one battle.
                </li>
                <li>B. Each Battle Card contains the instruction to draw a Strategy
                    Card after the active player’s impulse. Draw the replacement
                    Strategy Card after all other activity in the impulse has been
                    completed. If more than one Battle Card has been played as
                    in a Major or Minor Campaign, then a replacement card is
                    drawn for each one. Normally it will not matter which player
                    replaces their card first, but in cases where it may matter (such
                    as when the Strategy Card Deck will become exhausted) the
                    player taking their impulse replaces their Battle Cards first.
                </li>
                <li>C. Except for Special Event Strategy Cards, any Event Strategy
                    Card may be discarded to gain a +1 die roll modification
                    in Battle (
                <span><a href="9 battles.html/#9_45">9.45</a></span>). 
                    An Event Strategy Card discarded for this
                    purpose is not replaced by drawing another Event Strategy
                    Card, nor may it be retrieved by the exchange procedure used
                    during the Strategy Card Phase 
                (<span><a href="#6_32_C">6.32.C</a></span>).
                </li>
                <p class="note">Play Note: This mechanic can be used to discard an opponent’s
                    event without fear of exchange. However, it does reduce the size
                    of one’s hand, possibly giving the opponent the opportunity to
                    make a back-to-back play.
                </p>
                <li>D. Each player may play/discard a maximum one Event Strategy
                    Card for each battle. The attacker decides to play/discard
                    first, then the defender makes his decision. During a Major/
                    Minor Campaign Event, each players may play/discard an
                    Event Strategy Card in every battle if they so choose.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="exemple"><strong>Clarifications</strong>: The “Benedict Arnold Treason” Battle card may
                only be played as an event during the battle resolution process.
                As with other Battle Cards, this card cannot be played as the
                event during the Strategy Card Phase simply to remove the Arnold
                General counter. The Arnold General counter does not have to
                be involved in the battle in order to play this Battle Card. When
                the event is resolved, the Arnold General counter is permanently
                removed from the game regardless of his current location (on
                the map, in the American Leader Reinforcement box or in the
                Captured Generals box). The American player may discard this
                card per 
            <span><a href="#6_32">6.32</a></span> or discard it as a battle card at his option.

            <h4 id="6_34">6.34 Special Event Strategy Cards</h4>   
            <p>A. There are seven Special Event Strategy Cards. They are
                indicated by the notation ‘Must Be Played’ at the top. These
                cards may not be discarded under any circumstances. The
                player drawing a Special Event card into his hand must play
                it at some point during the Strategy Phase of the game-turn in
                which he draws it. A player holding a Special Event Strategy
                Card does have the option of when during the Strategy Phase
                to play the card.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>B. When a Special Event Strategy Card is randomly selected
                and drawn from a player’s hand, its event is immediately
                implemented. The requirement to implement the event is
                mandatory regardless of which player drew the card, held the
                card, or which side benefits.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>C. The Special Event Strategy Cards are:
            </p>
            <ul class="liste_sans_puce">
                <li>(i.) Declaration of Independence. This event requires the
                    American player to place one PC marker in each of the
                    thirteen colonies (excluding Canada) where placement is
                    possible. Such placement is not optional, although the choice
                    of which space if there is more than one possible space is at
                    the option of the American player. PC marker placement is
                    limited by the restrictions listed in Rule 
                <span><a href="10 political control.html/#10_11_A_ii">10.11.A.ii</a></span>. 
                    British PC markers cannot be flipped even if an American Army or
                    General is present. The Declaration of Independence event
                    takes place even if the Continental Congress is currently
                    dispersed.

                    can potentially result in losses of American
                    PCs during a subsequent PC Isolation Phase (
                <span><a href="10 political control.html/#10_3">10.3</a></span>). This is intended.

                    <br>
                <p><strong>Optional Tournament Rule</strong>: Whenever the British player
                    plays either the Declaration of Independence or the Benjamin
                    Franklin: Minister to France Special Events, the event takes
                    effect as it normally does. However, the British player may
                    then draw a replacement card and immediately take another
                    action using any card (not necessarily the replacement card).
                    The DOI and Franklin events always occur first.

                <li>(ii.) Benjamin Franklin: Minister to France. Advance the
                    French Alliance marker four spaces towards “French Alliance”.
                    If play of this event results in the French Alliance
                    marker reaching +9, then immediately implement the effects
                    of the French Alliance; see 
                <span><a href="12 french alliance.html">12.0</a></span>.</li>
                <li>(iii.) Lord North’s Government Falls Card and the War
                    Ends Box. The “North’s Government Falls” cards are used to
                    regulate the end of the game. Each of the five cards changes
                    the end of the game to one of the years from 1779 to 1783.
                    To implement this event, place the card face up in the box on
                    the map labeled “War Ends Card”. If a “North’s Government
                    Falls” is already in the box, place it in the discard pile and
                    replace it with the card just played. In this way, should the
                    Strategy Card deck be reshuffled, except for the card currently
                    in the War Ends Box, all the other “North’s Government Falls”
                    cards will be returned to play. During the End Phase of each
                    Game Turn, the players will compare the current year with
                    the year shown on the “North’s Government Falls” card. If
                    the card shows the current year or a preceding year, then the
                    game ends and victory is determined; see
