            <h3 id="6_1">6.1 Dealing Strategy Cards and Reshuffling the Strategy Card Deck</h3>
            <p>In the Strategy Cards Phase of each game-turn, starting with the
            American player, both players are dealt a hand of seven Strategy
            Cards from the top of the Strategy Deck. These seven cards
            constitute each player’s hand.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A. When the Strategy Deck is fully depleted, including the
                situation where a Strategy Card deal is interrupted, reconstitute
                the Strategy Card deck as described below, and resume
                dealing if appropriate.</li>
                <li>B. The Strategy Card Deck is reconstituted when either an
                Event Strategy Card is played (not discarded) that requires the
                Strategy Card Deck to be reshuffled or when the Strategy Card
                deck is depleted. In every case all the discards and any cards
                remaining in the Strategy Card deck are shuffled to constitute
                a fresh Strategy Card deck. Only the current “Lord North’s
                Government Falls — War Ends” card and any Event Strategy
                cards that have been permanently removed from play due to
                the instruction on the card are excluded from the shuffle.
                Reshuffle Clarification
                If a reshuffle is triggered in the middle of the Strategy Phase
                (owing to deck depletion and a card draw is needed from
                the play of a Battle Card Event), the current “War Ends”
                card and any cards currently in the Reinforcement Card
                boxes are not shuffled.
                The “Declaration of Independence” (#99) and “William Pitt
                Urges Peace Talks” (#95) event cards trigger a Reshuffle
                when played as an event (not discarded) as per the rulebook—
                of course “Declaration of Independence can never
                be discarded. The “Hortelez et Cie” (#96) event, however
                is the opposite: “Hortelez et Cie” triggers a Reshuffle when
                discarded (not played) as per the card text.</li>
                <li>C. Either player may examine the cards in the Discard Pile at
                any time. Neither player may examine the cards in the Strategy
                Card Deck.</li>
                <li>D. Certain event cards may change the constitution of either
                player’s hand, as explained on the card itself. For example,
                if the American Player plays the “John Paul Jones Shipping
                Raids” event, one card is randomly drawn from the British
                player’s hand and is discarded.</li>
                <li>E. SPECIAL RULE: “Declaration of Independence” and
                “Baron Von Steuben Trains the Continental Army” Cards:
                During the initial setup of the game, the “Declaration of Independence”
                and “Baron Von Steuben Trains the Continental
                Army” cards are set aside; see 4.0. At the beginning of the 1776
                turn, shuffle both cards into the Strategy Card deck. This is not
                a re-shuffle per se, so the discards remain discarded unless an
                event requiring a reshuffle is played (or the French Alliance
                comes into effect) in 1775.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="6_2">6.2 Playing the OPS Cards</h3>
            <p>Most of the game play revolves around the use of OPS Cards.
            These cards let players conduct their military campaigns and take
            control of spaces and colonies. Each time a player plays an OPS
            Card, he may do one (and only one) of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Activate a General for movement, with or without
                Combat Units under his command. Activation can occur
                only if the General’s Strategy Rating is equal to or
                less than the number on the card. An OPS Card showing
                a “3” can therefore activate any General, while an
                OPS Card with a “1” can activate only a General who
                has a Strategy Rating of 1. The OPS Card with a “2”
                can activate Generals with Strategy Ratings of 2, or 1,
                but not 3.</li>
                <li>Add a number of PC Markers to the map equal to the
                number on the OPS Card. See <span><a href="">10.1</a></span> for details.</li>
                <li>Bring on Reinforcements. See 8.0 for details.</li>
                <li>Place that number of Operations into an Operations
                Queue. See 7.1.B for details.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>OPS Cards used for placing PC counters or moving
            Generals and Armies are played by placing
            the card face up on the Discard Pile. Those used
            to bring on reinforcements are placed face up in
            one of that side’s Reinforcement Card boxes to
            record that a reinforcement action has occurred. Those cards
            used to begin or extend an Operations Queue are played face-up,
            under an “Operations Queue” marker in front of the player until
            the Queue is used to activate a General or the Queue is abandoned.
            Once the Queue is used or abandoned all the OPS Cards
            associated with it are placed face up in the Discard Pile.</p>

            <h4 id="6_32">6.32 Discarding Event Strategy Cards</h4>
            <p>B. When a player discards an Event Strategy Card as his play
            during the Strategy Phase, he also takes one of the following
        actions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(i.) The card is simply discarded and no further action is taken; or</li>
                <li>(ii.) Place or flip one PC adjacent to a friendly PC subject to the additional restrictions in Rule 10.11; or</li>
                <li>(iii.) Remove one enemy PC from a space which is adjacent to a space containing a friendly PC counter and that is not
                occupied by an enemy CU, an American General or the Continental Congress.</li>
            </ul>
